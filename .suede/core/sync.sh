# .suede/core/sync.sh — update every piece of suede machinery vendored into

#
#   bash .suede/core/sync.sh [<path> ...]
#
# It finds them rather than being told: every subrepo whose remote is the suede
# library itself. In a fully initialized dependency that is four things.
#
#   .suede/core                 the maintainer's tools (this folder)
#   release/.suede/core         the tools that ship to consumers
#   .github/workflows           main's workflows
#   release/.github/workflows   the release branch's workflows
#
# Never ./release, which tracks this repository's own release branch: that one
# is published by push-release.sh, not pulled.
#
# Two of the four have a `.gitrepo` whose `parent` is meaningless here, for two
# different reasons, and both make `git subrepo pull` refuse:
#
#   * The workflow subrepos were cloned into the *template* this repository was
#     created from. A repository made from a template starts a fresh history,
#     so their parent names a commit that does not exist here at all. (They are
#     cloned into the template rather than at init because an Action is
#     restricted in what it may do to .github/workflows.)
#   * A `.suede/core` vendored onto the `release` branch before the layout
#     changed has a parent that does exist but is a release-branch commit, and
#     so is not an ancestor of `main`.
#
# Either way the fix is the same shape - point `parent` at a commit that IS in
# this history - so this repairs it and retries rather than making you read the
# failure. git-subrepo names the right commit when it can; when it cannot (the
# template case, where it suggests an empty SHA) the last commit that touched
# the subrepo is the honest answer, because that is the state on disk.
#
