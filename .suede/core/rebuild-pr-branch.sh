# rebuild-pr-branch.sh — the core git logic of suede-downstream-to-main.
#
# SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH: the action runs this file, and the test harness runs
# this same file. There is no copied logic and no runner emulation.
#
# Given a release-shaped submission branch, it: recovers the base release commit
# the consumer actually had, replays their change onto the latest release
# (conflicts -> markers), and transplants the result under release/ on top of
# main. It leaves the rebuilt content on the local branch $PR_HEAD_BRANCH for the
# caller to force-push.
#
# Inputs (env):
#   SUBMISSION_REF   required — the downstream/<...> branch name (== github.ref_name)
#   REMOTE           default: origin
#   MAIN_BRANCH      default: main
#   RELEASE_BRANCH   default: release
#   RELEASE_DIR      default: release
#   PR_HEAD_BRANCH   default: pull-request-head
#
# Outputs:
#   - appends base_commit / submission_commit / conflicted / has_changes to
#     $GITHUB_OUTPUT when that variable is set (i.e. inside Actions)
#   - always prints: RESULT base=<sha> conflicted=<bool> has_changes=<bool>
